# Logo Setup Instructions

## Modual Logo Placement

Please save your Modual logo file as `logo.png` in this directory (`/public/`).

### Logo Requirements:
- **Format:** PNG with transparent background
- **Recommended size:** 600x180 pixels (or similar aspect ratio)
- **File name:** `logo.png`

### Logo Colors:
The Modual branding uses a gradient from:
- Pink: #E94B8A
- Purple: #A855F7  
- Blue: #6366F1

### Where the logo appears:
- Header/navigation bar (150x45px)
- Login/registration pages (180x54px)
- User dashboard
- Footer (120x36px)

The logo component automatically adapts to different sizes and themes.

## Alternative: SVG Logo

If you prefer to use an SVG logo, you can also save it as `logo.svg` and update the Logo component in `/components/Logo.tsx` to use the SVG instead of PNG.

## Temporary Solution

If you don't have a logo ready yet, the application will show a broken image icon. You can create a simple placeholder by:

1. Creating a simple PNG with text "MODUAL" with the gradient colors
2. Using an online logo maker tool
3. Or temporarily using the gradient text fallback

The attached Modual logo from the user should be saved here as `logo.png`.
